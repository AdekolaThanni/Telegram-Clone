### **Built with**

- React
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion
- Node js
- Express js
- Mongo DB
- Cloudinary
- Socket.io
- WebRTC

### **Requirements**

- Enabling authentication of users and giving them a unique
  identifier e.g a username for their account. This is needed for
  two reasons, so the server can distinguish all users and
  authenticate them correctly and also users can share this username
  with other users so that they can message them from their end,
  more like how we share our phone numbers with people that would
  eventually call us in the future the username serves that purpose.

- Storing user credentials in order to remember their session the
  next time they visit the website. This avoids the user having to
  login everytime they visit the app.
- Ensuring cross-browser compatibility of the app. This ensures the
  app has a consisitent behaviour and outlook on all browsers be it
  Google chrome, Mozilla firefox, Internet explorer, Safari and so
  on.

- Ensuring real-time updates of app so users can see instant
  messages, sent/delivered/read receipts, online/offline presence of
  contacts and also call requests from their conta

- Ensured web application was responsive to all screen sizes to
  optimize accessibility across multiple devices.
